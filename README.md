# Credibble

### Problem Statement

Traditional lending institutions such as microfinance groups, cooperatives, and community lenders depend on steady funding to provide loans to individuals, students, farmers, artisans, and entrepreneurs.

When their access to affordable liquidity is limited, loan disbursements slow down, interest rates rise, and many are left without timely credit. This funding gap stalls business growth, reduces productivity, and causes a ripple effect that holds back both local and global economies.

Meanwhile, billions in DeFi yields remain locked within on-chain markets, disconnected from these real-world financing needs.

---

## Solution

Credibble bridges this gap by channeling DeFi liquidity directly into traditional lending pipelines through tokenized loan shares. Investors deposit digital assets into Credibble pools to earn sustainable returns, while vetted lending institutions access this capital to fund loans in their communities.
Each funding position is represented as an NFT, ensuring transparency, tradability, and proof of ownership.

By merging DeFiâ€™s efficiency with real-world lending needs, Credibble enables broader access to fair credit and fuels inclusive economic growth.
